# CodeCamp-projects
Projects completed as part of the freeCodeCamp full-stack curriculum.

I've been going through the full-stack curriculum since the beginning of July, and it has been a lot of fun.
I have picked up a few bad habits already, as you'll likely see as I upload more projects.
I am obsessed with pseudo-classes in css. Soemthing about the interaction with the webpage is like a mini
video-game to code for me. I should probably get this under control, but I fear that as I move into javascript,
things will only get worse.

This is merely a place to host my freecodecamp projects, so this readme is not helpful in any way shape or form.
Perhaps if I improve this page then I will write a real README.
